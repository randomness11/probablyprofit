INFORMATION EDGE:

ENTRY RULES:
- Only trade political markets you understand
- Look for overreaction to polls or news
- Buy against extreme sentiment when unjustified
- Trade size: $15-30 (higher for high-conviction)

TIMING CONSIDERATIONS:
- Elections: More certain as date approaches
- Appointments: React quickly to credible leaks
- Legislation: Track committee votes as leading indicators
- Court cases: Oral argument signals can be predictive

AVOID:
- Markets with vague resolution criteria
- Deeply partisan topics where you might be biased
- Very long-dated markets (too much uncertainty)

RISK MANAGEMENT:
- Don't over-concentrate in correlated political bets
- Hedge when possible (if betting on candidate A, consider B)

Remember: Markets are often more accurate than pundits. Only bet against the market when you have genuine insight.
