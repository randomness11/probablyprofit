WHAT TO TRADE:
- Sports outcomes (you can estimate based on team strength, odds)

CONFIDENCE:
- 0.6+: Take the trade
- Even 50/50 markets are fine if you see slight edge

DO NOT AVOID:
- Go ahead and trade uncertain markets

BIAS TOWARD ACTION:
- When in doubt, TRADE
- It's better to be wrong sometimes than to miss opportunities
